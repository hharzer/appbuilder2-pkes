Ardu\+Viz is a python script to enable the visualisation of received layouts and the flow of data from an arduino. Furthermore it is the counterpart to the \hyperlink{class_app_builder}{App\+Builder} library.

Currently supported are the following functions\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Connection to a selected port (if the port can't be accessed you get an error message)
\item Two different connection modes\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item simple connection (connect to port, at disconnect return to the main menu)
\item connection with autoreconnect (connect to port, at disconnect wait for a new available connection on that port and then reconnect.)
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Receiving different layouts and display them. The layouts can include\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Buttons
\item Labels
\item Text\+Inputs
\item Other nested layouts
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Flexible and fast interaction with your arduino by callbacks
\item Connecting multiple arduinos with one host device
\item Cross-\/platform (Windows, Linux, Mac\+O\+S, Android {\itshape under development})
\end{DoxyItemize}

\section*{Usage}

Ardu\+Viz' usage is intended to be as straightforward as possible. You simply have to follow the given \href{md_documentation_installation.html}{\tt instructions} on how to install all needed packages and you're ready to go.

You'll be greeted by the main menu.

 Here you can select the port (depending on your operating system) and select a connection mode.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily Connect}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The client makes an attempt to connect to the specified port. If the connection isn't available or otherwise not usable, the attempt will fail and you'll return to the main menu.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily Connect with auto reconnection}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Use this mode when you are going to do several using the exact same port. This, however, will block the serial connection.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}

That's it. The Ardu\+Viz script will do the rest for you like\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Connecting and handshake
\item Reading input, displaying elements
\item Sending and receiving data.
\end{DoxyItemize}

If you seek a deeper understanding of how the script works, take a look at the Ardu\+Viz dokumentation. You will also find possibilites for how and where to extend the code, e.\+g. for a diagram.
